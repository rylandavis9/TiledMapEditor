# TiledMapEditor
Put 16x16 tilesheets in tiles folder and voila

Created for my Java RPG, exporting map and tiles will export the map text file with a delimiter of " " and all tiles you have in the project.
Probably not much use outside of this game unless you want to use the same text files like this.
